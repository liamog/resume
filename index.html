								<h2>
									Microsoft Corporation
								</h2>
								<p>I joined Microsoft's MSTV group based in Mountain View ,CA. I transitioned from Cable TV software to a new project building an end-end IPTV solution, which was branded Mediaroom. After a few years I relocated back to Ireland and worked out of Microsoft's Dublin European Development Center (EDC). In all I spent more than 7 years in Microsoft -learned a great deal , met great software developers and built a product that I'm proud to say I was part of from the start.</p>

								<h4>Software Development Lead</h4>
								<h5>Mediaroom client platform </h5>
								<h6>November 2005- September 2010</h6>
								<ul>
									<li>Relocated back to Ireland - built and managed a development team to add DVB-T support to our client for the UK market. This was later extended to DVB-S for the German market, where we also integrated a Nagravision HD+ encrypted media support into platform.
									</li>
									<li>Had to get up to speed on Broadcast Digital TV very quickly on a tight schedule  which was already committed to the customer.
									</li>
									<li>Managed the integration of 3rd party MHEG engine into the our code-base. Engaged with local software vendor with specific digital TV domain knowledge to help with testing and implementation.
									</li>
									<li>Led the team through multiple releases of this middleware code. There were lots of dependencies to be managed between the team in the Ireland and the US based team through these releases.
									</li>
									<li>Lead the effort to re-factor the broadcast TV components in the client to support other broadcast standards, such as DVB-S,DVB-S2, DVB-C and ATSC. In addition to adding new features like sharing the tuners on the home network for multi-room scenarios.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Software Development Lead</h4>
								<h5>IPTV Server Group</h5>
								<h6>January 2004- November 2005</h6>
								<ul>

									<li>Managed a group of 6 developers. Had responsibility for a wide variety of server components as part of the MSTV IPTV product. This was renamed Microsoft Mediaroom at a later point
									</li>
									<li>Drove the design and implementation of a no-downtime user migration mechanism. This mechanism allowed a device's data to be moved from one cluster of servers (including database) to another cluster seamlessly. This allowed for rolling upgrades to essentially eliminate service downtime.
									</li>
									<li>Responsible for architecting 3-tier scalable server solution. SQL Server clusters, with many lighter weight application servers in front. Exposed to the set top boxes using asp.net web-services. Made extensive use of transaction processing methods to ensure data reliability.
									</li>
									<li>Development lead role in Microsoft is 50% development 50% management, so spent a great deal of time in architecture, technical leadership and communicating with extended server team. Developing critical code myself and reviewing team members code.
									</li>
									<li>Led the team through a re-organization into a newly formed product development group for the IPTV product.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Software Development Engineer Lead</h4>
								<h5>MSTV Applications</h5>
								<h6>November 2003 - January 2004</h6>
								<ul>
									<li>Promoted to Lead and given 3 direct reports. Continued to lead the development of the billing application. US Patent office recently approved patent for the reliable delivery of messages algorithms used in this application.
									</li>
									<li>Led the team through a re-organization into a newly formed product development group for the IPTV product.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Software Development Engineer Lead</h4>
								<h5>MSTV Applications</h5>
								<h6>November 2003 - January 2004</h6>
								<ul>							
									
									<li>Implemented extensible TCP Server class for a recommendations engine application for the MSTV cable product. As part of this also worked on the client side of the overall application - a very low powered Motorola set top box.
									</li>
									<li>Led design of a billing application for allowing cable TV users to view their bill on their TV.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Allegis Corporation</h2>
								<h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
								<h5>Tools</h5>
								<h6>March 2001 - April 2003</h6>

								<p>I joined Allegis (formerly Net-IT ) a startup based in San Francisco in June of 1998. This startup was focused on optimizing marketing and partner relationships for our customers. This evolved to being a SaaS only product offering to enterprises. This was a fantastic 5 years for me in terms of exposure to a fast growing and dynamic startup that rode the ups and downs of the dot com boom and bust. It made me realize that you need more than great engineering to be successful and gave me a deep appreciation for the sales cycle, site operations in addition to software product development.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Technical lead for the Allegis Tools project through multiple major and minor releases. Drove the initial business requirements project for the first version of Allegis Tools. Responsible for the design and implementation of this tool using C# and Windows Forms technologies.
									</li>
									<li>Heavily involved in the design and implementation of our Web Services strategy building upon the web services technology in the .net framework.
									</li>
									<li>Built a multilingual Excel add-in in C# that used web services technology to upload records to the Allegis application for bulk operations.
									</li>
									<li>Worked extensively on the port of our business application platform to the Java platform.
									</li>
									<li>Technical advisor to consulting team on specific customer integration projects.
									</li>
									<li>Involved with a prototype project with Microsoft Biztalk Server for a customer integration project. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Development Manager</h4>
								<h5>Integration team</h5>
								<h6>December 1999 - March 2001</h6>
								<ul>							
									<li>Built and managed the Integration team within the development organization. Brought the team from just myself to a total of 7 people.
									</li>
									<li>Responsible for developing the integration tools and technologies that were used by our consulting engineering organization to implement backend integrations for customer deployments.
									</li>
									<li>Developed and shipped multiple versions of Allegis Openlinks - an XML web services engine that predated SOAP. This engine allowed consulting engineers to write declarative scripts that exposed the underlying business objects to external systems.
									</li>
									<li>Drove the requirements for our Allegis XML API and supervised its implementation. This API is a set of standard scripts built upon the Openlinks framework that exposed the common entities used in the majority of our integrations. This allowed customer to integrate to our product without needing time from our consulting engineers. It also allowed our consulting engineers to quickly customize these integrations instead of expensive one-offs for each customer.
									</li>
									<li>Oversaw the development of a client-side Java Toolkit to be deployed at our customers’ site to enable them to quickly integrate to our product.
									</li>
									<li>Developed AIM (Allegis Integration Manager) a website deployed at our hosting center that allowed customers and CE's to be alerted if an integration message failed. It also provided debugging and logging services.
									</li>
									<li>Presented at many sales calls to answer questions regarding the Allegis integration strategy.
									</li>
									<li>Advised the hosting team on deploying the Allegis application and maintaining high availability of the integration interfaces exposed by the application. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
								<h5>Core platform</h5>
								<h6>June 1998 - December 1999</h6>
								<ul>
									<li>Principal member of the technical team that designed and built the core platform that eventually the Allegis PRM solution would be built upon.
									</li>
									<li>Built many components for the system in C++ and COM. Originally developed for MTS , and then migrated to COM+ later.
									</li>
									<li>Implemented the integration to the Microsoft Active Scripting engine for business logic.
									</li>
									<li>Designed the Administration UI for the platform.
									</li>
